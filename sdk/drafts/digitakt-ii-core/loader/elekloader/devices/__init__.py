"""Device profiles: everything elekloader knows about one Elektron product.

A profile names the stock releases it supports (by hash, so a file is
recognised by its content, not its name) and the facts the patcher,
the linker and the verifier need about that product's firmware:

  - the container: which section is the main OS, its load address, how it
    is stored, whether the file carries a trailer;
  - the bootloader: where it stages the main OS before unpacking it in
    place (the verifier simulates that), and the flash budget;
  - the CPU: which instruction decoder checks patch sites;
  - where mods may live at run time (the free memory areas), and where the
    linker puts their code and data.

To add a device, write a module here with a Device subclass and add it to
DEVICES (docs/DEVICES.md).
